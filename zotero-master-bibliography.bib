  abstract = {Do insurance plans offered through the Marketplace implemented by the State of California under the Affordable Care Act restrict consumers' access to hospitals relative to plans offered on the commercial market? And are the hospitals included in Marketplace networks of lower quality compared to those included in the commercial plans? To answer these questions, we analyzed differences in hospital networks across similar plan types offered both in the Marketplace and commercially, by region and insurer. We found that the common belief that Marketplace plans have narrower networks than their commercial counterparts appears empirically valid. However, there does not appear to be a substantive difference in geographic access as measured by the percentage of people residing in at least one hospital market area. More surprisingly, depending on the measure of hospital quality employed, the Marketplace plans have networks with comparable or even higher average quality than the networks of their commercial counterparts.},

Using data from Massachusetts' pioneer insurance exchange, I find substantial adverse selection against plans covering the most prestigious and expensive ``star'' hospitals. I highlight a theoretically distinct selection channel: these plans attract consumers loyal to the star hospitals and who tend to use their high-price care when sick. Using a structural model, I show that selection creates a strong incentive to exclude star hospitals but that standard policy solutions do not improve net welfare. A key reason is the connection between selection and moral hazard in star hospital use.},

  abstract = {By steering patients to cost-effective substitutes, the tiered design of prescription drug formularies can improve the efficiency of healthcare consumption in the presence of moral hazard. However, a long theoretical literature describes how contract design can also be used to screen consumers by profitability. In this paper, we study this type of screening in the ACA Health Insurance Exchanges. We first show that despite large regulatory transfers that neutralize selection incentives for most consumer types, some consumers are unprofitable in a way that is predictable by their prescription drug demand. Then, using a difference-in-differences strategy that compares Exchange formularies where these selection incentives exist to employer plan formularies where they do not, we show that Exchange insurers design formularies as screening devices that are differentially unattractive to unprofitable consumer types. This results in inefficiently low levels of coverage for the corresponding drugs in equilibrium. Although this type of contract distortion has been highlighted in the prior theoretical literature, until now empirical evidence has been rare. The impact on out-of-pocket costs for consumers affected by the distortion is substantial\textemdash{}potentially thousands of dollars per year\textemdash{}and the distortion creates an equilibrium in which contracts that efficiently trade off moral hazard and risk protection cannot exist.},

  shorttitle = {Regionalizing {{Emergency Care}}},
  abstract = {During medical emergencies, hospital staff and emergency medical services (EMS) providers, can face barriers in delivering the fastest and best possible care. Overcrowded emergency rooms cannot care for patients as quickly as necessary, and some may divert ambulances and turn away new patients outright. In many states, ambulance staff lacks the means to determine which hospitals can provide the best care to a patient. Given this absence of knowledge, they bring patients to the closest hospital. In addition, because emergency service providers from different companies compete with each other for patients, and emergency care legislation varies from state to state, it is difficult to establish the necessary local, interstate, and national communication and collaboration to create a more efficient system. 

In 2006, the IOM recommended that the federal government implement a regionalized emergency care system to improve cooperation and overcome these challenges. In a regionalized system, local hospitals and EMS providers would coordinate their efforts so that patients would be brought to hospitals based on the hospitals' capacity and expertise to best meet patients' needs. In September 2009, three years after making these recommendations, the IOM held a workshop sponsored by the federal Emergency Care Coordination Center to assess the nation's progress toward regionalizing emergency care. The workshop brought together policymakers and stakeholders, including nurses, EMS personnel, hospital administrators, and others involved in emergency care. Participants identified successes and shortcomings in previous regionalization efforts; examined the many factors involved in successfully implementing regionalization; and discussed future challenges to regionalizing emergency care. This document summarizes the workshop.},

  shorttitle = {Triage of Elderly Trauma Patients},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are frequently undertriaged. However, the associations between triage patterns and outcomes from a population perspective are unknown. We hypothesized that triage patterns would be associated with differences in outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a population-based, retrospective, cohort study of all injured adults aged 55 years or older, from 3 counties in California and 4 in Utah (2006 to 2007). Prehospital data were linked to trauma registry data, state-level discharge data, emergency department records, and death files. The primary outcome was 60-day mortality. Patients treated at trauma centers were compared with those treated at nontrauma centers. Undertriage was defined as an Injury Severity Score (ISS) {$>$}15, with transport to a nontrauma center.
RESULTS: There were 6,015 patients in the analysis. Patients who were taken to nontrauma centers were, on average, older (79.4 vs 70.7 years, p {$<$} 0.001), more often female (68.6\% vs 50.2\%, p {$<$} 0.01), and less often had an ISS {$>$}15 (2.2\% vs 6.7\%, p {$<$} 0.01). There were 244 patients with an ISS {$>$}15 and the undertriage rate was 32.8\% (n = 80). Overall 60-day mortality for patients with an ISS {$>$}15 was 17\%, with no difference between trauma and nontrauma centers in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. However, the median per-patient costs were \$21,000 higher for severely injured patients taken to trauma centers.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population-based analysis of triage patterns and outcomes in the elderly. We have shown high rates of undertriage that are not associated with higher mortality, but are associated with higher costs. Future work should focus on determining how to improve outcomes for this population.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) is required to account for uncertainty in cost-effectiveness calculations arising from health economic models. The simplest way to perform PSA in practice is by Monte Carlo methods, which involves running the model many times using randomly sampled values of the model inputs. However, this can be impractical when the economic model takes appreciable amounts of time to run. This situation arises, in particular, for patient-level simulation models (also known as micro-simulation or individual-level simulation models), where a single run of the model simulates the health care of many thousands of individual patients. The large number of patients required in each run to achieve accurate estimation of cost-effectiveness means that only a relatively small number of runs is possible. For this reason, it is often said that PSA is not practical for patient-level models. We develop a way to reduce the computational burden of Monte Carlo PSA for patient-level models, based on the algebra of analysis of variance. Methods are presented to estimate the mean and variance of the model output, with formulae for determining optimal sample sizes. The methods are simple to apply and will typically reduce the computational demand very substantially.},

  issn = {1935-469X},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Only 2\% to 5\% of adult patients with cancer enroll onto clinical trials. We assessed simultaneously characteristics of patients and their physicians that may be independently associated with participation.
METHODS: CanCORS, a National Cancer Institute (NCI) -funded population-based observational cohort study of newly diagnosed patients with lung and colorectal cancers, sampled patients across five geographic areas, five health care delivery systems, and 15 Veterans Administration hospitals. We linked patient survey and medical record data with physician survey data to examine correlates of trial enrollment.
RESULTS: Among 9,901 patients, 5.3\% enrolled onto trials. Of the 9,901 patients, we linked 6,506 patients to one medical oncologist, surgeon, or radiation oncologist (physicians, N = 1,325) who responded to the physician survey and was considered their primary cancer clinician decision maker. Patient age, race, disease stage, geographic region, and health insurance were independently associated with trial enrollment. Physician factors independently associated with patient trial enrollment were being a medical oncologist, practicing at an NCI-designated cancer center, taking the lead in discussing trials with patients, and receiving increased income from trial enrollment. After simultaneously adjusting for patient and physician characteristics, only being a physician practicing at an NCI-designated cancer center (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.19 to 2.27) and patient female sex (OR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.10 to 1.68), age {$>$} 70 versus {$<$} 50 years (OR, 0.28; 95\% CI, 0.16 to 0.48), and advanced disease (OR, 1.85; 95\% CI, 1.45 to 2.37) remained independently associated with trial enrollment.
CONCLUSION: Both practice environment and patient clinical and demographic characteristics are associated with cancer clinical trial enrollment; simultaneous intervention may be required when trying to increase enrollment rates.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the representation of racial/ethnic minorities, women, and older persons among participants in surgical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).
METHODS: The NCI Clinical Trial Cooperative Group surgical oncology trials database was queried for breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers treated during the period 2000-2002 (n=13,991). Data from the SEER program and the Census were used to estimate age-, gender-, and race/ethnicity-specific incidence of the same cancers among U.S. adults during the same period. Enrollment fraction (EF), defined as the number of trial enrollees divided by the estimated U.S. cancer cases in each demographic group, was the primary outcome measure. Logistic regression was used to compare the enrollment of racial/ethnic, gender and age subgroups in this analysis.
RESULTS: Relative to white patients (EF=0.72\%), lower EFs were noted in African-American (0.48\%, odds ratio [OR] vs whites 0.67, P{$<$}0.001), Hispanic (0.54\%, OR 0.76, P{$<$}0.001), and Asian/Pacific islander (0.59\%, OR 0.82, P=0.001) patients. Overall, women were more likely to enroll in surgical trials (1.12\%) than men (0.22\%, OR 5.06, P{$<$}0.001). Patients 65-74 years of age (EF 0.45\%) were less likely to be enrolled than those 20-44 years of age (EF=2.28\%, OR 0.20, P=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The enrollment in surgical oncology trials is very low across all demographics. However, racial/ethnic minorities and older persons are less likely to be enrolled in cooperative group surgical oncology trials than are whites and younger patients. The high EF for women is due to the high availability of trials for women with breast cancer. Strategies to increase accrual to surgical trials and ameliorate disparities related to race/ethnicity, gender, and age are needed.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Only 2\% to 5\% of adult patients with cancer enroll onto clinical trials. We assessed simultaneously characteristics of patients and their physicians that may be independently associated with participation.
METHODS: CanCORS, a National Cancer Institute (NCI) -funded population-based observational cohort study of newly diagnosed patients with lung and colorectal cancers, sampled patients across five geographic areas, five health care delivery systems, and 15 Veterans Administration hospitals. We linked patient survey and medical record data with physician survey data to examine correlates of trial enrollment.
RESULTS: Among 9,901 patients, 5.3\% enrolled onto trials. Of the 9,901 patients, we linked 6,506 patients to one medical oncologist, surgeon, or radiation oncologist (physicians, N = 1,325) who responded to the physician survey and was considered their primary cancer clinician decision maker. Patient age, race, disease stage, geographic region, and health insurance were independently associated with trial enrollment. Physician factors independently associated with patient trial enrollment were being a medical oncologist, practicing at an NCI-designated cancer center, taking the lead in discussing trials with patients, and receiving increased income from trial enrollment. After simultaneously adjusting for patient and physician characteristics, only being a physician practicing at an NCI-designated cancer center (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.19 to 2.27) and patient female sex (OR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.10 to 1.68), age {$>$} 70 versus {$<$} 50 years (OR, 0.28; 95\% CI, 0.16 to 0.48), and advanced disease (OR, 1.85; 95\% CI, 1.45 to 2.37) remained independently associated with trial enrollment.
CONCLUSION: Both practice environment and patient clinical and demographic characteristics are associated with cancer clinical trial enrollment; simultaneous intervention may be required when trying to increase enrollment rates.},

This raises questions about the capacity of the health care workforce to meet increased demand. I used data on office-based physicians from the 2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Electronic Medical Records Supplement to summarize the percentage of physicians currently accepting any new patients. Although 96 percent of physicians accepted new patients in 2011, rates varied by payment source: 31 percent of physicians were unwilling to accept any new Medicaid patients; 17 percent would not accept new Medicare patients; and 18 percent of physicians would not accept new privately insured patients. Physicians in smaller practices and those in metropolitan areas were less likely than others to accept new Medicaid patients. Higher state Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratios were correlated with greater acceptance of new Medicaid patients. The findings serve as a useful baseline from which to measure the anticipated impact of Affordable Care Act provisions that could boost Medicaid payment rates to primary care physicians in some states while increasing the number of people with health care coverage.},

  volume = {54},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: 
Strategic alignment and integration is currently in vogue throughout the health care industry, but its diffusion and pace have not been documented in recent years. The full range of downstream implications from greater alignment between hospitals and physicians has also not been completely explored.
OBJECTIVES:
We track the organizational landscape among all office-based US physician practices from 2009 to 2015 and document the degree of vertical integration over time. Then, we examine the implications of vertical integration on practices' acceptance of publicly insured patients.
RESEARCH DESIGN:
We use descriptive trends and linear regression models with practice level fixed effects to capture the relationships between within-office changes in integration behavior and changes in public payer acceptance.
RESULTS:
Independent (nonintegrated) physician practices are still the most common organizational type, but their share is declining as the share of practices integrated with a health system increases 3-fold between 2009 and 2015. Although {$>$}80\% of practices that are part of a health system accept Medicaid, {$<$}60\% of independent practices will see these patients. Vertically integrating with a health system makes it more likely a practice will start seeing Medicaid patients.
CONCLUSIONS:
Integration-and possibly consolidation-appears to be occurring and may be increasing over time in the United States. However, it also seems to increase the number of physician practices participating in the Medicaid program. This beneficial side effect has not been previously documented and should be kept in mind as policymakers weigh the pros and cons of a more integrated health care system.},

  abstract = {The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has prompted health plans to increase their use of ``narrow networks'' of providers as a cost containment strategy. These plans have proven popular on the ACA marketplace because they carry lower premiums. Yet consumers have little information to guide them on the tradeoff between lower premiums and network size when shopping among the various plans offered on the ACA marketplace. Regulators and policymakers also have little information on these networks. New federal requirements for updated, accurate provider directories create an opportunity to signi cantly improve consumers' ability to make more informed health plan choices. The Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics has assembled the  rst integrated dataset of physician networks for the plans offered on the ACA marketplace. This data brief uses this new resource to describe the breadth of the physician networks in plans sold on the state and federal marketplaces. The percent of physician networks that were classi ed as small or x-small came to 41\% overall, 55\% for HMO networks, and 25\% for PPO networks.},

  abstract = {Policy Points:

* Increasingly, Americans are relying on coverage through a family member to maintain continuous insurance when their own employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) ends. Meanwhile, employers have responded by limiting access to and imposing surcharges on dependent coverage elections.

* Between 2005 and 2013, adults who transitioned off ESI became likely to enroll in a non-group plan and were twice as likely to become uninsured. Special Enrollment Period enrollment figures under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) suggest these dynamics have not meaningfully changed since 2014.

* Moving forward, more Americans will rely on alternative sources for affordable health insurance outside the ESI system. New ACA outreach efforts are needed to identify and enroll the large and increasing number of individuals who face the end of ESI benefits throughout the year.

Context

Employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) is the predominant form of health insurance coverage in the United States, yet little is known about transitions into and out of ESI or whether turnover has increased over time.

Methods

We fit multistate dynamic transition models for adults aged 18-61 using Survey of Income and Program Participation data from 2005-2007 to 2010-2013 and preliminary Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from the period 2012-2014.

Findings

Over a 2-year period beginning in 2010, 34.6\% of adults with ESI experienced a change, up from 31.7\% in 2005-2007. Transitions occurred most frequently among young adults, Hispanic adults, low-income adults, those in fair or poor health, and service industry workers. But even the groups with the lowest turnover\textemdash{}older adults, married adults, and those with a college degree\textemdash{}had 2-year rates of change of up to 30\%. The probability that an ESI policyholder regained an employer-based policy after a job change declined by 15\% between 2005 and 2013. Meanwhile, the probability that an ESI policyholder enrolled as a dependent on another family member's plan or became uninsured increased twofold. We found little evidence of changes in these dynamics during the first year (2014) of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) major coverage reforms.

Conclusions

Increasingly, Americans are relying on dependent ESI coverage through a family member to maintain continuous insurance when their own employer-based benefits end. Those who transitioned off ESI were also less likely to enroll in a non-group plan and were twice as likely to become uninsured. The first year of the ACA did not see material changes in the likelihood that an ESI-insured adult became uninsured or switched to an alternative public or private plan. New ACA outreach efforts are needed to identify and enroll the large and increasing number of individuals who face the end of ESI benefits throughout the year.},

While quality measures are crucial to such reforms, they face major criticisms largely over the potential failure of risk adjustment to overcome endogeneity concerns. In this paper we implement a methodology for estimating the causal relationship between hospital quality measures and patient outcomes. To compare similar patients across hospitals in the same market, we xploit ambulance company preferences as an instrument for patient assignment. We find that a variety of measures used by insurers to measure provider quality are successful: assignment to a higher-scoring hospital results in better patient outcomes. We estimate that a two-standard deviation improvement in a composite quality measure based on existing data collected by CMS is causally associated with reductions in readmissions and mortality of roughly 15\%.},

  abstract = {There is widespread agreement that the US healthcare system wastes as much as 5\% of GDP, yet much less agreement on the source of the waste. This paper uses the effectively random assignment of patients to ambulance companies to generate comparisons across similar patients treated at different hospitals. We find that assignment to hospitals whose patients receive large amounts of care over the three months following a health emergency have only modestly better survival outcomes compared to hospitals whose patients receive less. Outcomes are related to different forms of spending. Patients assigned to hospitals with high levels of inpatient spending are more likely to survive to one year, while high levels of outpatient spending result in lower survival. In particular, we discovered that downstream spending at skilled nursing facilities (SNF) is a strong predictor of mortality. Our results highlight SNF admissions as a quality measure to complement the commonly used measure of hospital readmissions and suggest that in the search for waste in the US healthcare, post-acute SNF care is a prime candidate.},

  shorttitle = {Dropping the {{Baton}}},
  abstract = {Context: In the United States, more than a third of patients are referred to a specialist each year, and specialist visits constitute more than half of outpatient visits. Despite the frequency of referrals and the importance of the specialty-referral process, the process itself has been a long-standing source of frustration among both primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists. These frustrations, along with a desire to lower costs, have led to numerous strategies to improve the specialty-referral process, such as using gatekeepers and referral guidelines. Methods: This article reviews the literature on the specialty-referral process in order to better understand what is known about current problems with the referral process and what solutions have been proposed. The article first provides a conceptual framework and then reviews prior literature on the referral decision, care coordination including information transfer, and access to specialty care. Findings: PCPs vary in their threshold for referring a patient, which results in both the underuse and the overuse of specialists. Many referrals do not include a transfer of information, either to or from the specialist; and when they do, it often contains insufficient data for medical decision making. Care across the primary-specialty interface is poorly integrated; PCPs often do not know whether a patient actually went to the specialist, or what the specialist recommended. PCPs and specialists also frequently disagree on the specialist's role during the referral episode (e.g., single consultation or continuing co-management). Conclusions: There are breakdowns and inefficiencies in all components of the specialty-referral process. Despite many promising mechanisms to improve the referral process, rigorous evaluations of these improvements are needed.},

We evaluated the impact of a tiered-network health plan on total health care spending and on inpatient, outpatient, and outpatient radiology spending for nonelderly enrollees in a commercial health plan in 2008\textendash{}12. The tiered network was associated with \$43.36 lower total adjusted medical spending per member per quarter (\$830.07 versus \$873.43), which represented about a 5 percent decrease in spending, relative to enrollees in similar plans without a tiered network. Similar levels of spending reductions were found for outpatient (4.6 percent) and outpatient radiology spending (6.5 percent). These findings suggest that health plans with tiered provider networks have the potential to reduce aggregate health care spending.},

  abstract = {Although there has been significant interest from health services researchers and policy makers about recent trends in hospitals' ownership of physician practices, few studies have investigated the strengths and weaknesses of available data sources. In this article, we compare results from two national surveys that have been used to assess ownership patterns, one of hospitals (the American Hospital Association survey) and one of physicians (the SK\&A survey). We find some areas of agreement, but also some disagreement, between the two surveys. We conclude that full understanding of the causes and consequences of hospital ownership of physicians requires data collected at the both the hospital and the physician level. The appropriate measure of integration depends on the research question being investigated.},

The two measures are highly correlated, and show a wide range of networks available to consumers. We then estimate consumer willingness-to-pay for network breadth, which varies by age. 60-year-olds value the broadest network approximately \$1200-1400/year more than the narrowest network, while 30-year-olds value it about half as much. Consumers place additional value on star hospitals, and there is significant geographic heterogeneity in the value of network breadth.},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as ``modularity'' over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

DATA SOURCE: 2015 SK\&A office-based physician survey linked to all commercial and public payer ACOs.
STUDY DESIGN: We construct three separate Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) measures and plot their distributions. We then investigate how prevailing levels of concentration change when incorporating more detailed organizational features into the HHI measure.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Horizontal and vertical integration strongly influences measures of physician concentration; however, ACOs have limited impact overall. ACOs are often present in competitive markets, and only in a minority of these markets do ACOs substantively increase physician concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring ACO effects on physician competition will likely have to proceed on a case-by-case basis.},

  abstract = {By steering patients to cost-effective substitutes, the tiered design of prescription drug formularies can improve the efficiency of healthcare consumption in the presence of moral hazard. However, a long theoretical literature describes how contract design can also be used to screen consumers by profitability. In this paper, we study this type of screening in the ACA Health Insurance Exchanges. We first show that despite large regulatory transfers that neutralize selection incentives for most consumer types, some consumers are unprofitable in a way that is predictable by their prescription drug demand. Then, using a difference-in-differences strategy that compares Exchange formularies where these selection incentives exist to employer plan formularies where they do not, we show that Exchange insurers design formularies as screening devices that are differentially unattractive to unprofitable consumer types. This results in inefficiently low levels of coverage for the corresponding drugs in equilibrium. Although this type of contract distortion has been highlighted in the prior theoretical literature, until now empirical evidence has been rare. The impact on out-of-pocket costs for consumers affected by the distortion is substantial\textemdash{}potentially thousands of dollars per year\textemdash{}and the distortion creates an equilibrium in which contracts that efficiently trade off moral hazard and risk protection cannot exist.},

We found that the common belief that Marketplace plans have narrower networks than their commercial counterparts appears empirically valid. However, there does not appear to be a substantive difference in geographic access as measured by the percentage of people residing in at least one hospital market area. More surprisingly, depending on the measure of hospital quality employed, the Marketplace plans have networks with comparable or even higher average quality than the networks of their commercial counterparts.},

I used data on office-based physicians from the 2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Electronic Medical Records Supplement to summarize the percentage of physicians currently accepting any new patients. Although 96 percent of physicians accepted new patients in 2011, rates varied by payment source: 31 percent of physicians were unwilling to accept any new Medicaid patients; 17 percent would not accept new Medicare patients; and 18 percent of physicians would not accept new privately insured patients. Physicians in smaller practices and those in metropolitan areas were less likely than others to accept new Medicaid patients. Higher state Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratios were correlated with greater acceptance of new Medicaid patients. The findings serve as a useful baseline from which to measure the anticipated impact of Affordable Care Act provisions that could boost Medicaid payment rates to primary care physicians in some states while increasing the number of people with health care coverage.},

  volume = {54},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: 
Strategic alignment and integration is currently in vogue throughout the health care industry, but its diffusion and pace have not been documented in recent years. The full range of downstream implications from greater alignment between hospitals and physicians has also not been completely explored.
OBJECTIVES:
We track the organizational landscape among all office-based US physician practices from 2009 to 2015 and document the degree of vertical integration over time. Then, we examine the implications of vertical integration on practices' acceptance of publicly insured patients.
RESEARCH DESIGN:
We use descriptive trends and linear regression models with practice level fixed effects to capture the relationships between within-office changes in integration behavior and changes in public payer acceptance.
RESULTS:
Independent (nonintegrated) physician practices are still the most common organizational type, but their share is declining as the share of practices integrated with a health system increases 3-fold between 2009 and 2015. Although {$>$}80\% of practices that are part of a health system accept Medicaid, {$<$}60\% of independent practices will see these patients. Vertically integrating with a health system makes it more likely a practice will start seeing Medicaid patients.
CONCLUSIONS:
Integration-and possibly consolidation-appears to be occurring and may be increasing over time in the United States. However, it also seems to increase the number of physician practices participating in the Medicaid program. This beneficial side effect has not been previously documented and should be kept in mind as policymakers weigh the pros and cons of a more integrated health care system.},

These plans have proven popular on the ACA marketplace because they carry lower premiums.

Regulators and policymakers also have little information on these networks. New federal requirements for updated, accurate provider directories create an opportunity to signi cantly improve consumers' ability to make more informed health plan choices. The Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics has assembled the  rst integrated dataset of physician networks for the plans offered on the ACA marketplace. This data brief uses this new resource to describe the breadth of the physician networks in plans sold on the state and federal marketplaces.

It has the capacity to perform microsimulation models more efficiently than software commonly used for decision modeling, incorporate statistical analyses within decision models, and produce more transparent models and reproducible results. However, no clear guidance for the implementation of microsimulation models in R exists. In this tutorial, we provide a step-by-step guide to build microsimulation models in R and illustrate the use of this guide on a simple, but transferable, hypothetical decision problem. We guide the reader through the necessary steps and provide generic R code that is flexible and can be adapted for other models.

  abstract = {Multi-state models are often used for modeling complex event history data. In these models the estimation of the transition probabilities is of particular interest, since they allow for long-term predictions of the process. These quantities have been traditionally estimated by the Aalen\textendash{}Johansen estimator, which is consistent if the process is Markov. Several non-Markov estimators have been proposed in the recent literature, and their superiority with respect to the Aalen\textendash{}Johansen estimator has been proved in situations in which the Markov condition is strongly violated. However, the existing estimators have the drawback of requiring that the support of the censoring distribution contains the support of the lifetime distribution, which is not often the case. In this article, we propose two new methods for estimating the transition probabilities in the progressive illness-death model. Some asymptotic results are derived. The proposed estimators are consistent regardless the Markov condition and the referred assumption about the censoring support. We explore the finite sample behavior of the estimators through simulations. The main conclusion of this piece of research is that the proposed estimators are much more efficient than the existing non-Markov estimators in most cases. An application to a clinical trial on colon cancer is included. Extensions to progressive processes beyond the three-state illness-death model are discussed.},

The standard way of incorporating covariates in multi-state models is by considering the transitions as separate building blocks, and modeling the effect of covariates for each transition separately, usually through a proportional hazards model for the transition hazard. This typically leads to a large number of regression coefficients to be estimated, and there is a real danger of over-fitting, especially when transitions with few events are present. We extend the reduced-rank ideas, proposed earlier in the context of competing risks, to multi-state models, in order to deal with this issue.},

  abstract = {Competing risks data arise naturally in medical research, when subjects under study are at risk of more than one mutually exclusive event such as death from different causes. The competing risks framework also includes settings where different possible events are not mutually exclusive but the interest lies on the first occurring event. For example, in HIV studies where seropositive subjects are receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), treatment interruption and switching to a new HAART regimen act as competing risks for the first major change in HAART. This article introduces competing risks data and critically reviews the widely used statistical methods for estimation and modelling of the basic (estimable) quantities of interest. We discuss the increasingly popular Fine and Gray model for subdistribution hazard of interest, which can be readily fitted using standard software under the assumption of administrative censoring. We present a simulation study, which explores the robustness of inference for the subdistribution hazard to the assumption of administrative censoring. This shows a range of scenarios within which the strictly incorrect assumption of administrative censoring has a relatively small effect on parameter estimates and confidence interval coverage. The methods are illustrated using data from HIV-1 seropositive patients from the collaborative multicentre study CASCADE (Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe).
